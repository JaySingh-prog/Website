<!--Hello, maker! Welcome to my Electrate Fuego web design tutorial. I'm glad you found it – for this might be a real intersection on your way to becoming. Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll make a really cool web documemt that not only introduces you to the other people in our classes, but will help you process how different discourse communities in your life have contributed to your arrival in this space, virtual and actual, and also contribute to where you might be going.

In this doc, you will work through Gregory Ulmer's discourses of career, family, entertainment, community, and schooling (_Internet Invention From Literacy to Electracy_, 2002.) In Ulmer's text, he elides community and schooling into one category, but for our puposes I have separated them. Ulmer's theory of electracy helps makes sense of how we find/construct meaning and connect with others rhetorically in a media rich ecology. Ulmer uses analogy to define electracy, explaining that "electracy is to digital media what literacy is to print."

You could make this document the easy way by posting on Google Site, an Adobe Spark, a Weebly, or a Wix, or you can do a little more work to unconceal, opening up these tools that you use every day, but might not know how they function, yet prove so necessary to how you (re)present yourself and connect with others in virtual spaces. And this last bit is an important point! If we really want to be makers, if we really want to be creative, then we need to understand what our digital tools do, how they work, and consider the implications of their use. Through this process you will also learn a little bit about computer literacy and computer science...enough to allow you to build web texts and understand file management.

So let's cut this thing open – using "tmesis" as the Ancient Greeks would call it – lets "cut" and arrange, tweak, take away and augment...that's how we create! I hope you're excited to use this tool to create a document that will simultaneously help you process your journey and help orient you along the path on which you are headed in your becoming. Before we get going I would like to give a shout-out to my research buddy Shauna Chung, who helped me develop the original Ulmerian framework we will be following in this document. Are you ready to get started?-->

 <!--To get started, you will need to fork my repository from GitHub if you haven't already. If you want to easily publish it on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, fork, and then download the website to a zip file (or clone it, if you know what that means). Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your other assests like images, pdfs, etcetera. You will also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "atom.io" or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the index.html and style.css files in the text editor and we can get started building our own electrate experience.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these hidden HTML text fields be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS file. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating to font, text size, image size, among other details.-->

<!--The <body> of the document houses the content that a user usually sees on a website. We'll be spending most of our time in this section.-->
<body>

<!-- We'll need to do some more work in this section, but to do so, we'll need to make some changes on your style.css file. Developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block," but we will refer to it as a "Wide Image."  Think carefully about the image you select and how it might serve a sybolic function in your life. Ulmer refers to these kinds of symbolic images as "wide images" in that they often repeat over and over in our lifetime. We will similarly repeat this image at the end of your Electrate Infuego composition to establish a motif in this web document.-->

<!--The hero image is controlled on the style.css page. To replace this image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it hero.jpg. Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, and change the file type from .jpg to .png. Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png imgaes. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->

<!--In our first exploration of discourse, we're going to think about the wider characteristics or themes of our field or future career. In academia, we do a lot of work narrowing our interest to arrive at a career or profession, often reducing our field to a level of operation or an act. Instead, I would like you to think more broadly about the "wider themes" you associate with your field or future career and its larger significance in improving our world. Yes...improving the world. Thinking back, where do you see exposure to those same "wider themes" in your own life? Those ah-ha moments, lessons, examples, tools, passions, or qualities that suggested this career path to you? Replace the content between <p> and </p> that begins with "Lorem ipsum."-->

  <p>I have 2 main hobbies, reading and playing badminton. I like playing badminton with friends, it gives me a fun and easy way to unwind, especially after a long day and allows me to relax and have fun. My other main hobby is reading, my favorite series being the Harry Potter series. I like reading as it allows me to relax, both be alone from the outside world and be in a new one of the author’s creating. It Is a fun way to take a break when stressed and is usually pretty enjoyable. My third favorite hobby is crew or rowing. It’s a sport where you have to race in a boat with teammates and in general is highly focused on teamwork and precision and to do good you must have both. This allows me to build a better team building skill while at the same time also allows me to focus on myself physically, as to take part you must be athletic having both power and stamina. It is a great team sport for someone who wants to develop better teamworking skills and generally be healthier. </p>

<!--Now we are moving into the kinds of media that contributes to your everyday discourse. This might sound weird, but Ulmer argues that media has actually contributed a great deal to who you are as a person, how you language yourself, and even how you move through the world and interact with others. So, let's take some time to explore this discourse area. You have the opportunity to add video content or other significant media content. You might also add images to this section (see the bottom of this sheet for directions on how to add elements) perhaps adding a photo grid like the one you did for the "Family" section. Experiment. You can't break this thing, right? Control Z. Control Z. Control Z... -->

  <h2>Encomium Essay</h2>

  <p>Terminator is an old and beloved movie that has greatly affected both movie culture and society. It is known for being an anti-Ai movie and has brought up a lot of interesting concepts that up until that date  the world had not seen . It brought up the concept of AI rebelling and turning against humanity, but how accurate is that? Are we close to that point with Chat GPT and other generative AI? How will AI affect us, will it be net positive or negative? Will it be the biggest threat to humanity, or will we still hold that title? 
Terminator’s effect on our society has been great , the impacts of this film still affect us and people today despite it being made over 4 decades ago. It planted the idea of AI rebelling and causing catastrophic consequences, but is that really true?  The simple answer is yes, in theory AI could eventually reach such a point where it can amass power and data and cause a sort of apocalypse. However, the long answer is no. AI like we have today is not conscious, it can only do tasks assigned to it. AI we have today has no mind nor purpose beyond what we give it. So, despite common logic dictating that AI can’t go rogue why do people fall for fearmongering spread by popular movies like Terminator? The reason is based in psychology and lack of knowledge. People psychologically remember the bad over the good (Baumeister), making movies that portray AI negatively -such as The Terminator- be a lot more impactful than movies that portray AI positively -such as Wall-E. This holds true unless the quantity of good -AI supportive movies- greatly outnumbers and drowns out the bad- unreasonably AI critical movies. (Baumeister). In a survey it was shown that out of 1,666 responses in a survey about where people get their news about AI, 560 came from media entertainment, while only 572 came from the actual news   (Nader Karim, et al), showing the huge impact media has. Furthermore, most people don’t know much about AI. For example only 37% of the American public believe that natural language processing - Natural language processing, is a branch of AI which involves using algorithms to analyze, understand, and generate human language (Hyperscience), a common example being Siri on Apple iPhones, or google translate. - uses AI. (Nader Karim, et al). People d on’t understand AI very well and thus are more susceptible to media, thus, increasing negative media would nat urally lead to worse outlooks on it as a whole. 
Are we currently close to an AI of Skynet’s l evel -an AI powerful and smart enough to cause nuclear war? No, we are not. We are not even close to the level of what Skynet is. Our AIs cannot rebel against us the way Skynet had. AIs at our level are not conscious, by nature they run on algorithms and cannot actually think. Due to this, they are barred from non-algorithmic and non-computable processes, such as true creativity, idea generation, sentience and consciousness.  As advanced as our computers are today the main difference between the ones we have now and older models is processing speed and sto rage despite new software. Our computers can mainly just run at a faster rate than they used to. In all our AI have only changed in specs. This is shown as despite these improvements, AI cannot pass the “Lovelace Test” which tests for true creativity ( Mind Matters). Moreover AI actively sabotages itself due to the way its neural network is set up. AIs use deep learning, the leading technology for pattern recognition. Deep learning allows it to learn extremely complex tasks, such as diagnosing diseases even more accurately than physicians, however it is very easy to fool and skew the data, thus disrupting the AIs int ended purpose. (University of Cambridge) This limiting factor on AI causes a decrease in accuracy over time,   and so cannot be used alone in important fields in which mistakes have serious consequences. There must be a human counterpart in order to stop it from potentially making a dangerous mistake – this is seen in robotic surgeries today. With all of these limitations that AIs currently face it is impossible for an AI to do as much damage as Skyne t.
Will AI be the biggest threat to society, or do we still hold that title? People currently still hold this title. AI is extraordinarily limited in terms of what it could do, however in the same vein it is incredibly versatile. AI can’t do much by itself, but it can help people do certain tasks. It can help people simply gather information or do more complex tasks like surgeries. In the end its use and value is determined by what the user asks it to do. AI is too limited to be play a major role in war, in part due to machine learning. Is AI really our biggest threat, or even a threat at all in this stage of its developme nt?
